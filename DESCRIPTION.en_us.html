    Pochaevsk is a contemporary Church Slavonic font that reproduces the typeface used in editions published by the Holy
    Dormition Pochaiv Lavra in the late 19th century and, subsequently, in editions published in the 20th century by
    Holy Trinity Monastery in Jordanville, New York.

    Due to its small vertical metrics, this font is convenient
    for use in bilingual editions featuring Church Slavonic text
    and text in another languages.
